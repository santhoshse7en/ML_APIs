It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., \u201csailboat\u201d, \u201clion\u201d, \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images. You can build metadata on your image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new marketing scenarios through image sentiment analysis.
