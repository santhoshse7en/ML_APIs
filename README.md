## Installation
Install this library in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) using pip. [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a tool to create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), itâ€™s possible to install this library without needing system install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system dependencies.
